# SALTAD
The SALTAD software package is comprised of a series of "C" language function modules for image processing multiframe image data to detect moving asteroids in a star cluttered background. The software utilizes a matched filter detection algorithm to enhance moving point sources propagating with a linear, constant velocity. The software registers each frame of the multi-frame set, estimates and removes the stationary background, estimates the second order noise statistics (covariance matrix) and suppresses the clutter (whitens) the demeaned imagery. A hypothesis set of motion directions and speeds are used to form the matched filter output, tested via CFAR detection, screened for false alarms, to produce a final list of moving object detections. The software is highly modularized for interfacing to existing NEA search facility software and has been used at the Spacewatch facility of the University of Arizona.
